   - **MAE**: 1.80
   - **MSE**: 9.22
   - **RMSE**: 3.04

### - Best Model:

The **`XGBoost Regressor`** appears to be the best model among the ones compared. It has the highest R² score (0.9987), indicating that it explains the variance in the data better than the other models. Additionally, it has the lowest MAE (1.55), MSE (5.27), and RMSE (2.30), which suggests that its predictions are the most accurate and closest to the actual values.

The Random Forest Regressor also performed very well, but XGBoost slightly edges it out in terms of accuracy.


### - Other than `XGBoost`, the `Random Forest Regressor` is the next best model based on the metrics:

- **R² Score**: 0.9977 (very close to XGBoost)
- **MAE**: 1.80
- **MSE**: 9.22
- **RMSE**: 3.04

### Why Random Forest?

- **High R² Score**: It has a very high R² score, meaning it explains almost all the variance in the data.
- **Low Errors**: The MAE, MSE, and RMSE values are low, indicating that the predictions are accurate and have minimal deviation from the actual values.

This combination of high accuracy and low error metrics makes the Random Forest Regressor a strong choice, second only to XGBoost.


### - Between **`Linear Regression`** and the **`Decision Tree Regressor`**, the **`Decision Tree Regressor`** is the better model based on the following metrics:

### Decision Tree Regressor:
- **R² Score**: 0.9924
- **MAE**: 3.50
- **MSE**: 30.38
- **RMSE**: 5.51

### Linear Regression:
- **R² Score**: 0.9656
- **MAE**: 8.48
- **MSE**: 138.12
- **RMSE**: 11.75

### Why Decision Tree?

- **Higher R² Score**: The Decision Tree Regressor has a significantly higher R² score (0.9924 vs. 0.9656), meaning it explains more variance in the data.
- **Lower Errors**: The MAE, MSE, and RMSE are all much lower for the Decision Tree, indicating that its predictions are closer to the actual values compared to Linear Regression.

In summary, the Decision Tree Regressor outperforms Linear Regression in terms of both accuracy and error metrics, making it the better choice between the two.

### 1. **XGBoost Regressor**:
   - **Why it’s the best**: 
     - XGBoost is known for its performance in handling large datasets and complex patterns. Its boosting algorithm iteratively improves the model by focusing on errors made in previous iterations, leading to highly accurate predictions.
     - **Key Metrics**: It has the highest R² score (0.9987) and the lowest error metrics (MAE: 1.55, MSE: 5.27, RMSE: 2.30), indicating it’s the most precise model overall.

### 2. **Random Forest Regressor**:
   - **Why it’s the best** (after XGBoost):
     - Random Forest is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions, which reduces variance and improves accuracy. It’s particularly effective at managing overfitting compared to individual decision trees.
     - **Key Metrics**: Although slightly less accurate than XGBoost (R²: 0.9977), it still has very low errors (MAE: 1.80, MSE: 9.22, RMSE: 3.04). The robustness of Random Forest across various datasets and its ability to generalize well make it a strong candidate after XGBoost.

### 3. **Decision Tree Regressor**:
   - **Why it’s the best** (compared to Linear Regression):
     - The Decision Tree Regressor creates a model that predicts the target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. It's capable of capturing non-linear relationships, which Linear Regression cannot.
     - **Key Metrics**: It has a higher R² score (0.9924) and lower errors (MAE: 3.50, MSE: 30.38, RMSE: 5.51) compared to Linear Regression. This makes it better suited for capturing complex patterns in the data, leading to more accurate predictions.

### 4. **Linear Regression**:
   - **Why it’s the best** (among the models with higher errors):
     - Linear Regression is a simple, interpretable model that works well when the relationship between the features and target is approximately linear. It’s computationally efficient and easy to implement, making it a good choice for initial modeling efforts.
     - **Key Metrics**: Despite having lower R² (0.9656) and higher errors (MAE: 8.48, MSE: 138.12, RMSE: 11.75), it can still be valuable when interpretability and simplicity are prioritized over prediction accuracy. It’s particularly useful when the assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity hold true.

### Summary:
- **XGBoost** is best for accuracy and handling complex data patterns.
- **Random Forest** is best for reducing variance and avoiding overfitting.
- **Decision Tree** is best for capturing non-linear relationships in the data.
- **Linear Regression** is best when simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability are more critical than accuracy.
